# Semantic Components Showcase

This application presents the semantic components that are currently implemented in [shiny_semantic](https://github.com/Appsilon/py_shiny_semantic).

The app is divided into sections, where each section represents one component. Each section is divided into subsections to display possible variants/options of how the components may be rendered or used. All components can be accessed from a sidebar on the left.

The source code of this application is conveniently split into shiny modules. When you find a component of interest in the demo app, you can easily find the code used to render it in a corresponding file inside the _modules_ folder.
